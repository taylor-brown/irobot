README

to compile - use MS VS 2008 w/ .NET 3.5.

to run - 
load obstacle and goal/start files first.
Any item on the "View" menu and the Run menu is now selectable.
Run initiates a connection to a create on com19 and runs the plan according to the odometry readings.
Note:
The robot expects to be facing in the positive y direction at the start location.
Units are assumed to be in meters.

The HW4 folder contains specific algo's.  the other folders are for controlling the irobot create through bluetooth and are probably more generally useful.
